## Welcome to our morse code project for pebble :)

To use our app, simply download the .pwd file and push it to your own pebble 
```pebble install xxxx.pwd```

The app works as such, tap fast for a '.' and hold for a '-', the letters will automatically be converted after 1 second.
To make things better, __swipe right__ (as if you're swiping the tabletop, we're assuming you have your watch on your left hand here) to make a " " (space)
